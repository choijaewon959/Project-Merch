Merch is mostly built with the Javascript and Jquery, which is old and fundamental in website development for a long time, so this sources are more suitable for beginners interested in building website for the first time.

# Project-Merch
* Merch is the second hand buy and sell website for University students in Hong Kong.
* You can upload the products that you want to sell, or make a request for the products that you need.
* When you upload the products, you have to input the title, category, price, description, condition, and hashtags to make the products easy to be searched.
* When you search for the products, you may want to search the products with their titles, descriptions, or hashtags so that you can search with all the related keywords that you find useful in finding the product.
* By using the category, price, and condition filters, you can eliminate down the unnecessary information in finding the products that you are looking for.

# Prerequisites
* Need to install xampp or mamp or other hosting tools to run the local host server in your laptop environment.
* Make sure to get javascript run on your web browsers.
* Make sure you are connected to the internet because most of the libraries and dependencies are from other online servers that are deployed on the other websites.
